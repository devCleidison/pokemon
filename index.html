                  In March 2003, the first third-generation games were released,
                  better known to gamers as the Advance generation, as their
                  original RPGs were made for the Game Boy Advance handheld:
                  Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire, which surpassed 3.1 million units
                  sold, thus being the most commercialized in Japan in 2002[16]
                  brought 135 new Pokémon, but it was impossible to transfer
                  Pokémon from previous generations to the games, as their
                  training in Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire was based on another
                  system, that of Effort Values ​​(effort values), points that,
                  when well calculated and distributed to the Pokémon, made it
                  stronger than others trained without this method. In order to
                  get some of the older Pokémon, Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire would
                  link up with other third-gen games, most notably Pokémon
                  Colosseum, one of that generation's platform-type games.

                  released in Japan. Pokémon Diamond & Pearl introduced 106 new

                  attacks part, dividing them into three types (Physical, which

                  page of the little monsters. More details will come on the
                  15th, but the information released shows that the launch will

                  New Pokémon X & Y games are announced for October 2013 now for
                  a new platform, Nintendo 3DS, in the Kalos region. The three
                  new starter Pokémon are Fennekin (Fire), Chespin (Grass) and
                  Froakie (Water) and the legendary Pokémon Xerneas (Pokémon X)
                  and Yveltal (Pokémon Y) with a new 3D gaming experience. This
                  was the game that most surprised the entire franchise with
                  many new features, starting with the one that most surprised:
                  The Mega Evolutions, which are evolved versions of some
                  Pokémon. It is a temporary evolution, so it only happens
                  during a battle if the Pokémon holds its respective Mega Stone
                  (the item that makes it mega evolve). Already mega evolved
                  Pokémon can have a change in Status, Abilities and even the
                  type of Pokémon! It's important to remember that only one
                  Pokemon can Mega Evolve per battle! Another big news was the
                  addition of the Fairy type that has new Pokémon and even some
                  old ones that had this type added or replaced by the old one,
                  such as Togekiss, which was Normal/Flying type and turned into
                  Fairy/Flying type! This type was created in order to balance
                  the game from the Competitive side that in the past generation
                  was dominated by Dragons since Fairy has advantage and
                  immunity to Dragons.
